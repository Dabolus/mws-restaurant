#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

The project uses yarn and gulp to execute development and build tasks.
The available scripts are:

```bash
yarn lint          # calls the gulp lint task, that will lint HTML, CSS and JS
yarn build         # calls the gulp build task, that will minify and copy the project to the dist folder
yarn serve:dev     # serves the unminified files from the src folder
yarn serve:prod    # builds the project and serves the production ready files from the dist folder
```
